// Feel free to write unit tests for BooEdit here.  These are not required
// but you might find this to be a useful way to verify that various parts
// of your program are working.  I've provided a couple of examples, so you
// can see roughly what these tests might look like.  See also the comments
// in TestableBooEdit.hpp for more details about how to use it.
